## Step 0: Clone this Repo (bit.ly/ada-css) ##

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaidamasaki/ada-css-presentation.git
```

## Step 1: Top Level (together) ##

### Spec ###
* `header` should be at the top span width of the entire body.
* `#popular-stories` should be 300px wide and on the right.
* `main` should sit next to `#popular-stories` on the left and fill
  the remaining horizontal space.
* `footer` should be at the bottom and span the width of the entire body.

As I mentioned in the presentation the first thing I like to do when I
start styling a new webpage is position the top level elements.
